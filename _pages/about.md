I am a final-year bachelor student at the EE department of Sharif University  with a focus on RL and Optimization.

I previously interned at [CUHK DSP Lab](http://dsp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/). Right I'm working on Reinforcement Learning used in Legged Robots. I also enjoy reading about different optimization techniques used in RL settings or in general.
